CAN IK, White Self-Existing Wind. My wind of change came in autumn 2014\. And after a period of turbulence, I found the answers in my heart. This made me reshuffle the cards and priorities in my life. Making a major switch and holding back no longer. Enough with the fears and anxieties of 'what other people think'. So I shed off the cloak of my spiritual-self, picked up my guitar and started making music. Scared still, but with confidence found in synchronic events.

Living through and overcoming the fears I finally dared to show my cards and colours to the world. The journey has only started. Starting this site is another step.

To all fellow travelers, seekers, dreamers: thank you for inspiring me. To all doubters, waiters and cold-feeted hesitants, I hope I can be of some inspiration to you. See you down the road!
