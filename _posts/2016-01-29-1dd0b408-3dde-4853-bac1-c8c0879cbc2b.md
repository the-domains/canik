CAN IK, White Self-Existing Wind. The wind of change to my story came in 2014\. And after a somewhat turbulent period, I found the answer in my heart. This made me reshuffe my cards and priorities. No holding back. Enough with the fears and anxieties of 'what other people think'. So Ished off the cloak of my spiritual-self, picked up my guitar and started making music. And shared this with the world. Scared still, but with confidence.

Living through and overcoming fears I finally dared showing my cards and colours to the world. The journey has only started. Starting this website is another step.

To all fellow travelers, seekers, dreamers: thank you for inspiring me. To all doubters, waiters and cold-feeted hesitants, I hope I can be of some inspiration to you. See you down the road!
