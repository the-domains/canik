# About CANIK

CAN IK is Martin Kuipers. This page is dedicated to my audiovisual work, music and the things that are an inspiration to my conversion of time to art. 

T(e) = Art or 'Time is Art' lies the core of the Law of Time. A teaching that gives the tools to explore and surf the waves of synchronicity and the archetypal universe.
